# AbyssusInfinitum

very pro pack with lot of processing chains<br>
it happen on skyblock world so u must be very pro with ur automation skill!!!

## Installation

**warning!!** only [prismlauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/) and its alternatives (maybe idk) are supported. what are u even doing if ur not using it lol!!

ok so running `install-dev.py` in pack folder will create the `.minecraft` directory in the parent directory of `pack`, and also generate the required files for prismlauncher to boot it

instructions:
```console
$ cd <wherever your prism instances are. on windows they are at %APPDATA%\Roaming\PrismLauncher\instances>
$ mkdir abyssusinfinitum
$ cd abyssusinfinitum
$ git clone https://github.com/glomdom/AbyssusInfinitum pack/
$ cd pack
$ python3 install-dev.py
$ # and ur done!!! now just restart/open prismlauncher and it should be there
```
